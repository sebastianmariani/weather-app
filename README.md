# weather-app

I made this [project](https://sebastianmariani.github.io/weather-app/) in order to understand and learn how to **get** and utilize informations from an API. In this case I used *OpenWeather api* and JS to create a simple  weather app that would get the name of the city as an input and give back all the information about the weather, the temperature, the min-max temperature and retrieve the current date.

## Instruction

In order to have a more accurate result, and avoid get the weather from the wrong city, first enter the name of the city you want to search and then the abbreviation of the country it is in, separated with a comma.
